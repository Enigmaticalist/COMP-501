<h1>The Moral Implications of White Hat Hacking in Cybersecurity.</h1>


</ul><p>White hat hacking refers to ethical hacking practices, where individuals use their technical skills to identify and fix security vulnerabilities in systems, 
with the consent of the system owners. 
This proactive approach helps protect against malicious attacks and promotes cybersecurity.</p>
